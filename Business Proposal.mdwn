# Business Project Proposal
### Question/need:
- What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?
The purpose of this project will be to analyze features of my data to understand which one(s) contribute most to the attrition rate of unions within each state.
- Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?
I will advise the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Undustrial Organizations (AFL_CIO) as they are the larger representation of American unions.
### Data Description:
- What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?
All the datasets I'm using are csv/excel files.
https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/union-membership-coverage - Data on union membership rates and general employment rates in each state from 1983 - 2015 based on census state code. Data was aggregated from http://www.unionstats.com/, so I can add on data from 2016-2020 if needed.
https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.t01.htm - This table (among others) gives demographic info for union and non-union members per state per year. (Unsure if I'll use this, but adding it just in case.)
Census.govhttps://www2.census.gov › cps › tables › time-series - Downloadable excel file showing median household income by year by state.
https://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/right-to-work-laws-and-bills.aspx - Enactment of right-to-work laws by state.
- What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?
An individual unit of analysis would be the corresponding union membership/income/etc. data per state per year (aka a row of data in my final table). The columns I'd like to include are: state, year, Union sector, Employed people, Employed workers who are in a union, that percentage, workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement, that percentage, median household income, if right-to-work legislature existed in that year.
- If modeling, what will you predict as your target?
I want to report on the features and their impacts, so I won't be creating a model.
### Tools:
- How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?
I will use sheets to clean the data and Tableau to create my visualizations.
- Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?
No.
### MVP Goal:
- What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?
A MVP for this project would be a visualization showing how union membership has changed over the years.
